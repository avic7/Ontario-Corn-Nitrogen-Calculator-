# Ontario Corn Nitrogen Calculator Modernization 

## Overview
This project modernizes the existing Ontario Corn Nitrogen Calculator Tool by building an **interactive R Shiny app and also a dashboard**. It provides Ontario farmers, advisors, and researchers an opportunity to make nitrogen recommendations smarter, more interactive and data driven.


## Features
- **Farmer-Focused**: Easy-to-use UI with input options for:
  - Soil type
  - Previous crop
  - Corn price
  - Fertilizer cost
  - Target yield
- **Dual Units**: Output available in both **Metric** and **Imperial** units.
- **Version Control**: Project managed and updated via GitHub.


## Tech Stack
- **Technology used**: BaseÂ Rshiny
- **Structure**: Modularized using key files like app.R, ui.R, and server.R
- **Benefits**: 
  - Easy and straightforward app deployment.
  - Clearly structured separation of UI and Server logic.
  - Rapid interactivity and reactive updates to user inputs.
  - Strong compatibility with R statistical packages and models.

- **GitHub** (Version Control)
